# JS boilerplate

This is a Javascript template for quickly starting to build web applications with basic Webpack settings.

You can see the settings in the `webpack.config.js` file.

## Getting started

Choose one of the following options:

- Download ZIP
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/xenleme/js-boilerplate.git`
- Install dependencies with npm: `npm install`
- Install dependencies with yarn: `yarn install`

Then you can run dev server using a command `npm run dev-server` or `yarn dev-server`.

If you need a production bundle, run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to get it.
